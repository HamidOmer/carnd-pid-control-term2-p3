## Overview

In this project we will revisit the lake race track from the Behavioral Cloning Project. This time, however, we will implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!
The simulator will provide the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle.

PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative. These three controllers are combined in such a way that it produces a control signal.
